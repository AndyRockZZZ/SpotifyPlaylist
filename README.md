# SpotifyPlaylist
Create a new Spotify Playlist of Top 100 Songs from billboard.com<br>

<p>I have used a website called https://www.billboard.com/charts/hot-100/ to get my Top 100 songs requests.<br>You will need to add the date like this "2023-11-10" (Year-Month-Day). https://www.billboard.com/charts/hot-100/2023-11-10/</p>

# Example
<p>The date that I want to use for my playlist is "2016-11-12"<br> ![image](https://github.com/AndyRockZZZ/SpotifyPlaylist/assets/25687861/b27bbff9-0537-4472-ad8d-6c2c2770f9af)
